# BSTS302P - Advanced Competitive Programming II

Welcome to the repository for **BSTS302P - Advanced Competitive Programming II**. This repository contains all the Java solutions I have implemented as part of this course.  

## About the Repository  

This repository is a collection of codes and solutions crafted during my journey through the **Advanced Competitive Programming II** course. It showcases my problem-solving approaches, algorithmic techniques, and programming practices, all using Java.  

## Why Java?  

Java is a powerful, versatile, and efficient programming language widely used in competitive programming for its:  
- **Rich Standard Library**: Provides a plethora of utilities to handle various programming challenges effectively.  
- **Portability**: Write once, run anywhere.  
- **Performance**: Strikes a good balance between speed and memory management.  

## Usage  

Feel free to explore the code, try out the solutions, or adapt the approaches to your own competitive programming journey.
